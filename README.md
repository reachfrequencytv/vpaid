# vpaid
VPAID container for video advertising.

## ActionScript 3

VPAID is primarily delivered via Flash. For the time being, this is the main focus of this library.

However, wherever possible, the browser's native capabilities is preferred.

This primarily means that logging and pixel requests will happen via the browser.

If older browser or specific Flash feature sets are important, this may not be the most appropriate library.

## JavaScript

A JS library is does not yet exist for this library.

Handling events via JavaScript and the browser (see above) even if processed as AS3 will aid in the transition.

## VAST

This is not a VAST library. Please see https://github.com/reachfrequencytv/vast-js for a JavaScript VAST XML parser.

### VAST rendering

Please see https://github.com/tbuchok/vast-xml for rendering VAST XML files from objects.

### Tests

Pending.

### Contributors

Happy to get any help possible.
